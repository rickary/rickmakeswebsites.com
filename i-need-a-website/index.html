      <h2>How can you help?</h2>
      <p>I only take on projects if I think I can help you solve a problem. For example…</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You need a website to showcase your work and help build an audience</li>
        <li>You want to start selling your products online</li>
        <li>You’re losing customers because your current website is too slow, or no longer meets your needs</li>
        <li>You’re using spreadsheets and word documents to manage a process and need something bespoke building to take your business to the next level</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Or it might be something else. I like a challenge and love solving problems so get in touch, whatever stage you’re at, and I can help you talk through your options.</p>

          <q>We make natural cosmetics out of a shed in Lincoln. Can you help us sell our products online?</q>

        <div class="p-project">
          <span class="p-project__header">Content Management</span>
          <q>Our business is changing. Our old site has too much focus on news & events and not on the work that we do. Plus, it’s really difficult for us to manage our content.</q>

        <div class="p-project">
          <span class="p-project__header">Custom Application</span>
          <q>I’m using a word document to give my clients their travel itineraries. It’s taking me ages and doesn’t look professional or in-keeping with the rest of my brand.</q>

        <div class="p-project">
          <span class="p-project__header">Fast Event Site</span>
          <q>I need to be able to sell tickets for my next event, while retaining an archive of all my previous events. Oh, and a blog. And, can you make it really fast?</q>

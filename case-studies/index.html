        <h3>The Problem</h3>

        <div class="p-case__quote">
          <q>We make natural cosmetics out of a garden shed in Lincoln. Can you help us sell our products online?</q>
        </div>

        <p>The guys from KiteNest got in touch back in 2015 to see if I could help them build an e-commerce store for their growing product range and accompanying blog.</p>
        <p>They’d been selling their products at markets and festivals but wanted an e-commerce presence to help tell their story and attract business from further afield.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-case__solution p-wysiwyg">
        <h3>What I did</h3>
        <p><b></b>I offered a range of potential solutions</b> to KiteNest, with them eventually choosing to use <b>Perch Runway with the Shop add-on</b> to manage their site.</p>
        <p>Before we got started, <b>I found them a designer</b> who could work with their existing brand to create a website template.</p>
        <p>After the site launched in Autumn 2016 I continue to work with KiteNest, making incremental changes to their site to <b>improve performance, user experience and search engine optimisation</b>.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>

        <div class="p-case__quote">
          <q>I’m using a word document to give my clients their travel itineraries. It’s taking me ages and doesn’t look professional or in-keeping with the rest of my brand.</q>
        </div>

        <p>In 2015, Stephanie approached me to work on her existing website. She was happy with the site but needed a content management solution.</p>
        <p>A year after the site launched, Stephanie got back in touch to talk about a day-to-day problem with her business. For each client, she was painstakingly creating a travel itinerary in a Word document that she then saved as a pdf and sent to the client.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-case__solution p-wysiwyg">
        <h3>What I did</h3>
        
        <p>To solve the content management issue, <b>I added Perch CMS to Stephanies existing site</b>, giving her the ability to make changes to the content as desired. I also made some changes to the front-end of the site to make it more <b>mobile friendly</b>.</p>
        <p>For the itineraries, I <b>created a bespoke web application</b> and integrated it with the website, so everything is managed from one place. The application allows Stephanie and her team to create, manage and send interactive itineraries to her clients.</p>
        <p>Now, when a client arrives in Paris, they just need to scan the QR code on their welcome pack to see their bespoke itinerary, complete with videos, attachments, links, directions and more.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>

        <div class="p-case__quote">
          <q>Our business is changing. Our old site has too much focus on news & events and not on the work that we do. Plus, it’s really difficult for us to manage our content.</q>
        </div>

        <p>I’d worked with One&Other on a voluntary basis for a few years before they approached me to rebuild their website in 2015. They wanted to retain their community content (news & magazine) but also needed somewhere for their portfolio of creative works.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-case__solution p-wysiwyg">
        <h3>What I did</h3>
        
        <p>I came up with a new site structure that separated their community & creative work streams but gave each equal billing on the site.</p>
        <p>We worked together to come up with a design that reflected their existing brand.</p> 
        <p>I built them a site using <b>Perch Runway CMS</b> so they can easily manage all the different types of content in one place.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>

        <div class="p-case__quote">
          <q>I need a website that can have a varying amount of content depending on the time of year. I need it to help me sell tickets before an event and present an archive of all previous events & videos of talks. Plus a blog. Oh, and can it be really fast to load?</q>
        </div>

        <p>I’m my own client for DotYork and my list of demands on the website changes year on year. The basics are the same though. When there aren’t tickets on sale, I need the site to display details of previous events. Then, when we start to announce details for a new event, I need to add pages and content incrementally.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="p-case__solution p-wysiwyg">
        <h3>What I did</h3>
        
        <p>Perch Runway CMS makes managing all of my content (events, speakers, talks, videos, blog) a breeze. I was able to put performance ahead of design, focussing on the site loading quickly and being easy to use (but still look good), rather than having a site full of huge images.</p>
        <p>In the run up to the 2018 event, I spent some time working on making the site more performant, managing to decrease the size of the home page by half and double the load time. </p>
